## Welcome to HASH ðŸ‘‹

The `hashcareers` org on GitHub houses some of HASH's public and private repos used during developer recruitment. Challenges are structured so that there's really not much benefit in viewing these beforehand.

If you'd like to prepare for an interview or tech assessment at HASH your time will be better spent developing your general SWE, algorithms and language/ecosytem-specific knowledge than deconstructing any of these repos... we promise!
